# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor


## My Tasks
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


### Changes I made
In order to abide by accessibility standards, I did a few things to the code. First I added symantic html elements to the file by replacing many of the div tags 
with section, aside, main, and footer. Next I made sure all of the images have an alt tag and descition to make them accessible to screen readers. 

I made sure the elements follow a logical structure when viewing the code and observing the page. I also combined many elements of the css stylesheet for classes
and ids that share the same attibutes. This cuts down on the lines of code and makes a more efficient and procise end product.
